Listing blogs/sites/forums that I have followed regularly at some point in life and/or have had an impact on me (in rough order of discovery)

* [Matt Might's blog](http://matt.might.net), especially this article about [what CS majors should know](http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/). I read this at a time I was trying to switch over to computer science and I guess it was motivating (ended up doing none of the recommendations)? I binge read the blog and followed it for a while but I think he got busy and stopped posting. I like the minimalist style.

* [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/) is an immensely popular blog with long form posts about various topics. I think I came across the [procrastination article](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) first and it really struck a chord with me. Other favourite posts: [Elon Musk series](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html), [Religion for the nonreligious](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html). [Odd places series](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/07/odd-things-odd-places-intro.html) is super-cool, it has inspired me to study different countries and cultures

* [Schneier on Security](https://www.schneier.com/) is a blog I followed when I had some interest in cryptography and was trying to manufacture interest in computer security. He posts very regularly. I used to visit very often but I doubt I read even one article completely.

* Scott Aaronson [blogs](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/) about quantum computing (which I ignore), academia and life in general. Just a nerdy blog I check from time to time because of my long-standing interest in academia and specifically computer science research.

* Paul Graham's [essays](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) have been pretty influential, especially [How to do what you love](http://paulgraham.com/love.html). I have kind of got influenced by commentary on reddit and goodreads reviews about his book Hackers and Painters that he is too arrogant and I do tend to agree. He and Scott Aaronson suffer from the got-bullied-for-being-a-nerd problem. Exactly how toxic are American high schools? I check his twitter semi-regularly as well, not completely sure why.

* I started following [Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/naval) after I listened to this [podcast with Shane Parrish](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/naval-ravikant/). I vividly remember where I was and what point in my life I heard this. The way he talked about happiness, knowledge, reading, careers, etc captivated me. I started following him obsessively. I have come to realize over time that I do not agree with everything he says, and anyway these trite observations are useful when you discover them by yourself.
