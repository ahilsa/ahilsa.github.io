title: Why blogging
---

What do I want out of this blog?

- To achieve *clarity* in my thoughts, about my likes and dislikes

- *Explore* and talk about my interests, ranging from reading, science, philosophy, language to humour, fiction-writing

- *Produce* rather than consume, to have my own opinions rather than get influenced by others

- To improve my *writing* and presentation
